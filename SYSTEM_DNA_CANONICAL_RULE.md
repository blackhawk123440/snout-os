# System DNA Canonical Rule

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** Locked

---

## The Rule

**The AppShell + System DNA is the sole supported layout system.**

**Any deviation is a bug, not a design alternative.**

---

## What This Means

- All pages MUST use AppShell with explicit physiology prop
- No legacy layout systems are supported
- No page-specific styling overrides are allowed
- All styling MUST flow through tokens or system components
- Dark theme is not supported (white is the dominant surface)
- Motion, spacing, and energy are system-enforced, not page-defined

---

## Enforcement

- Type system enforces physiology prop requirement
- Code review should reject any deviations
- Legacy files are dead code and should be removed
- No "just for this page" exceptions

---

## Why This Matters

Uniform behavior builds trust. Consistency prevents drift. System governance prevents entropy.

**This rule prevents future "just for this page" decisions that degrade system integrity.**

---

**This is not negotiable. This is the system.**
